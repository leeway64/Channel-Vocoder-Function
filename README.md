# Channel-Vocoder-Function
This project created a channel vocoder function in MATLAB that could synthesize “robotic” sounding speech according to a user-designated sound file.

The channel vocoder is a method of altering a sound signal by band-pass filtering the modulator signal (the input) and the carrier signal, and then multiplying the modulator and the carrier signals together. The results are summed with the products of other frequency bands.
The channel vocoder can be used to create a robotic voice, which is used extensively as a sound effect. Another application is found in the realm of biomedical devices. To simulate what hearing speech is like for people with cochlear implants, the channel vocoder can be used.

I would like to credit UW Bothell professor Dr. Kaibao Nie for providing the specifications for the project, along with the "bands_cutoff.m" function.
